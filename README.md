# DRWCR - DYNAMIC RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND FACULTIES RESOURCE SHARING AND BLOGGING

A blog (a blend of the term web log) is a type of website or part of a website, which is the publication of regular articles over time in some area of personal or professional interest. Blogs are usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog . There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written . The software for writing blogs can be divided into user hosted (software application installed by web log authors to run on their own system) and developer hosted (software services operated by the developer, requiring no software installation for the blog author.)

This system allows both the students and faculties to create and share information. 

This system allows the users who are allowed by the management to access the website which makes no need to worry about anonymous users and spammers.

This proposed system enables both intra and inter institutional knowledge sharing easy and  user friendly.

It has a special feature where the creator can write and edit their writings online , within the website which makes the system time efficient and error free.

This system makes the knowledge sharing more effective and efficient.
